# Go-NMBS
A Go cli tool for when your on the go with the NMBS.

## Why

Why not? This cli tool is designed to efficiently know when my next train is
going to leave, as they tend to get cancelled or delayed often. I personally
have a custom qtile widget that calls this cli tool and displays the next
non-cancelled train and its delay.

## How

Thanks to these people I can just make some API calls: https://docs.irail.be/
